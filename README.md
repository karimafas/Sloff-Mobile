# Sloff Mobile App

Sloff is a mental wellbeing app for businesses that aims at reducing hyper-connectivity. Inspired by the pomodoro technique, employees can set a timer and take some time away from their phone while working. Based on how much time they've spent offline, they can then pick between a series of rewards set by their employer.

## Built with
* Flutter 2.0
* setState State Management
* Firebase Firestore, Analytics, Functions

## Preview
You can download and test the app at: https://www.sloff.app/mobile/. 

Please note that to access the app, users need to be invited by their company. To proceed with testing, firstly make a company account on our Panel as outlined [here](https://github.com/karimafas/Sloff-Panel#readme), then invite your employee with a company email (this can be fake). Once done, use the newly-added company email to create an employee account on the Sloff mobile app and test its features.
